Yo, I used to check out lyrics upon the format
Build with skill, with technique, computer A-DAT
My lyrical form is clouds on your brainstorm
I get hyped, think, thought flow

Acrobat, sink the track
Pump the track, dance missions
Clubs like spores react past those visions
And hurrying more reflects on the dancefloor

Blowing up, and having mad people showing up
Packing crowds, jam-packed venues
Needles collapse, while atmospheres continues

Sprinkle that
Winnin' like that
Movin' like that
Hittin' like that

The melody is phat
Yo, I'm on the energy source
The cosmic boss with Prodigy
Given astrology
My intellect's devour
With Diesel Power

Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
Blows your mind drastically, fanta-

Winston back rewind, diesel power
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
It has to be automatically
Check it out, you better work it out
Change to another route

My techniques, strategies, abilities
I leave cords of mics hanging like spring leaves
Do a track so fast, beyond from you and I
Lyrical tactics, vocal gymnastics

E's and pepped up
You get swept up
Smacked up, backed up
Your crew's all cracked up

Check it, slow pick, choose quick
You can't stick
My medical range is strange as angles
You get tangled twist aside affections

Channels repeat, complete, can't compete
Check the hour and texture, mind adventure
Exploit the point
Into tracks to devour
My intellects proceed
With Diesel Power

Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
Blows your mind drastically, fanta-

Back, attack, the wack, pack your fax to me
You don't want none high quality action be
Still standing, damaging your other manic
Quick reverse potent as the first verse

My amplifier blows on your worlds, higher
World's sire cuts like a barbed wire
Record-play, I pull up on you every day
Fast forward I move and I swing toward

Exit - load, put your brain in right mode
Selected mix, the man will perfect the fix
Heads lightly, bite me
Copy Xerox, cops sandblocks

You can't knock some out there
Upbeat lifting, shifting, persistent
Intelligent kingpin, flippin' astrology
As I roll with Prodigy
With Diesel Power

Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
Blows your mind drastically, fanta-

Model 706-8073421, robot sonic

Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
